## Review Issues & PRs

### New
* Issue #95 Add postpaid / prepaid / business information to KYC Match (Huub KPN) ([Issue #95](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/95))
  * Opened on June 7th; Discussion ongoing.
  * For KYC Match v0.2.0.
  * Huub KPN explained his proposal, followed by some discussion.
  * Huub KPN: Mobile connect KYC match has this feature, Netherland has this and very useful. Contracts are anonymous, so customer types are important. Prepaid users have to be careful to check identity through other means. What have been done in NL was to match minimum data. But discussion should be open for anti-fraud cases and so on.
  * Huub KPN: Customer can check the data or at least get confirmation that it is prepaid.
  * ?: No optional feature? MC spec has optional feature?
  * Huub KPN: in MC, this spec is optional.  In CAMARA, you should make it optional too. Some country is not interested, you might not want to share this information. In the EU market, there are obligation to identify customer irrespective of subscription type, but in NL very useful.
  * Jorge TEF: Tenure API is also suggested. Is this the match, so data is provided from customer?
  * Huub KPN: They normally check the identity of the user, everything to do with the use case of verifying the identity of a customer, Tenure is different, but can also help specify prepaid or postpaid
  * Jorge TEF: Limit optionality of the API, so separate API is good.
  * Huub KPN: there are some attributes that can’t be provided, at least add to KYC match the same as MC.
  * Clara TEF: 
  * Huub KPN: Reliability of SIM card, etc.
  * Clara TEF: What are the use cases of Tenure?
  * Hubb KPN: simply want to know somebody is reliable, put data to a kind of risk engine.
  * Clara KPN: independent from match.
	Huub KPN: can be used for multi-factor authentication. Banks who check passports are less likely interested in match but more in Tenure.
	Clara TEF: In Telefonica we know MC has this feature.  Match is true/false while prepaid/pospaid/business is raw data.
	Huub KPN: in enterprise police can find out later, so prepaid and business are different. That is a value I want to provide.


* Issue #96 Create a common enum for attributeMatch result (Gilles Orange)  ([Issue #96](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/96))
  * Opened on June 7th; Discussion ongoing.
  * For KYC Match v0.2.0.
  * Gilles Orange explained his proposal, followed by some discussion.
  * Gilles Orange: One enumeration for all attributes.
  * Toshi KDDI: will ask Gilles for explanation offline.  It is for next version? -> Gilles Orange: Yes.
  * Clara TEF: is this for version2? -> Gilles Orange: Yes.
  * Gilles Orange: all attributes provide at least enumeration, developer of API find it difficult unless common enumeration.  I’ll try to propose implementation of swagger.
  * Kevin Carr VDF:  are you trying to declare one common enum, instead of enum under each attribute? -> Gilles Orange: Yes.


* Issue #97 update and review CODEOWNERS and MAINTAINERS.md file (Hrebert DT)  ([Issue #97](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/97)) 
* PR #98 97 update and review codeowners and maintainersmd file (Hrebert DT)  ([PR #98](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/pull/98))
  * For General/Admin. To follow Governance Issue #134; modify the codeowners file and add GitHub user IDs to the maintainers.md file 
  * Opened on June 10th, and **Approved already**.

  * Jorge TEF: Yes.

  * Discussion ongoing ->Continue discussion on GitHub 
  * Clara Telefonica commented, followed by some discussion:
  * Clara TEF: Mostly acceptable proposal. Telefonica has already implemented this v0.1, so need backward compatibility. Telefonica would here propose not to enforce additional attribute for score, not to change attributes or objects, thus Scoring will not impact existing implementation.  Otherwise fine.
  * Kevin Carr VDF: Agree. Straightforward for developers to use.
  * Gilles Orange: Understand that backward compatibility is strongly needed.
  * Toshi KDDI: KDDI’s information is close to v0.1, so KDDI has the same position.

### Age Verification v0.1.0 – wip

* Issue #46 Creation of a Pull Request for Age Verification API ([Issue #46](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/46))
  * Discussion ongoing; Gille's summary appreciated.
  * Toshi KDDI commented "is it going to be Meta release? Almost ready for PR discussion?", after which there was some discussion:
  * Clara TEF: just mentioning additional attributes in order to validate user, our objective. We only have data birthdate of contract owner, which is reality. We would like to have this info for all user, ambition, not reality. Something we may be able to have in future. Having these attributes mandatory will be in future.
  * Huub KPN: one suggestion, we can make it entirely optional. Reflect score on the reliability of the data. We analyzed 30% of the end user are not contract owner, so with no data, we probably return 70%, it is not very reliable.
  * Clara TEF: same, even higher. We don’t have all data, even Legal asked us to filter some data.
  * Huub KPN: you can also provide very low score, in case if legal says.
  * Clara TEF:
  * Huub KPN: for example, if only family name is provided, reliability is now 70% to 85%. That’s how you can play with aggregate score, still useful for some use cases, and not mandating any attributes.
  * Huub KPN: additional attributes can be optional.
  * Clara TEF: I will provide comments to the issue.
  * Toshi KDDI: we have enough discussion for ver0.1 on validating user/contact owner. Any additional feature? Let’s wait for Telefonica comments, and then move on to PR discussion.

* PR #50 Initial contribution of Age_Verification.yaml ([PR #50](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/pull/50))
  * Discussion ongoing.  ->Continue discussion on GitHub 
  * Draft User Story has been proposed, but it is still to be modified depending on ongoing discussions, so, the draft user story cannot be approved at the moment.

* Issue #81 Add Age Verification to KnowYourrCustomer SP’s Scope in README ([Issue #81](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/81))
  * Created for AI #12.01.  Discussion ongoing.
  * A text proposed in the Issue.  A PR will be created if the proposed text is OK.  ->Will need to be modified in line with Issue #46 / PR #50.


### Tenure v0.1.0

* Discussion not yet started, so skipped today.
  * Clara Telefonica made a question, followed by some discussion:
  * Clara TEF: Question. This API is not to give how long this customer has been a customer of this operator. In some comments, mentioning contract, MSISDN has been assigned to that user, then what exactly does operator have to check data? How long the customer has been in place? It is understood that UK has this API.
  * Kevin Carr VDF: it is checking how long this number has been managed, MSISDN has been used, when that number joined to that network.  Recycle is another API.
  * Hubb KPN: need to be very clear about it, contract to end user? If contract is changed from business to personal to keep that number after leaving the company?
  * Clara TEF: if new carrier, then zero?
  * Huub KPN: if same carrier, Telefonica, do you reset? That is question we need to answer.
  * Toshi KDDI: Details should be discussed anyway.
  * Huub KPN: will comment.
