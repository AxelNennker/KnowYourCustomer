The Agenda was approved.


Note: Presentation on Age Verification by OIDF has been postponed to our next meeting (19th March) or before, due to their unreadiness.

Note: CAMARA had two events successfully during MWC24.  'Meet and greet' on Monday 26th at a meeting room in Fira Gran Via where MWC24 was held, and 'evening gathering' on Tuesday 27th at a hotel nearby.  Hope to meet KYC SP members on another occasion.


## Review MoM & Actions

* MOM 2024-02-20 draft as well as a corresponding PR was not yet created.  (Toshi was sorry for that.)

* Uploading the meeting material ([PR #58](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/pull/58)) was created a couple of hours before the meeting, so, review by SP members and approval by the code owners were expected.

* Actions:
  * Closed: None
  * Kept open: AI #06.03, #06.04, #06.06, #08.01, #08.02, #09.01(this was added after the Marth 05th meeting)


## Review Issues & PRs

### Match/Fill-in v0.1.0 – working on error correction and other refinement to create a release version

* Issue #18 KYC Match – Compare specifications ([Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/18))
  * It was supposed to be closed together with PR #51 and PR #52, but some discussions were ongoing.  ->Need to check if the discussions can be moved to a new issue for v0.2.0.

* Issue #22 KYC Match – KYC Match Request / Response attribute suffix ([Issue #22](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/22))
  * It was supposed to be closed, but Stefano Hutchison has commented pointing out a new point.  ->Need to check if the discussions can be moved to a new issue for v0.2.0., with Stefano who was absent from the meeting.

* Issue #40 CHANGELOG.MD ([Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/40))
* PR #57 Create CHANGELOG.MD ([PR #57](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/pull/57))
  * After Rafal DT's comment at the last meeting on Feb 20th, Toshi successfully created a PR to upload CHANGELOG.MD as a new file, based on the Gilles' draft and modified for inclusion of API description into the yaml.  Ready to be approved.

* A new issue: Country/countryCode/countryName attribute and for countryCode alpha-2 or alpha-3
  * Issue to be created.  **AI #10.01 (Toshi)**

* Telefonica Javier Carro and Fernando proposed to remove 'phoneNumberMatch' attribute from KYC Match yaml, because, if the phoneNumber sent in the Match request is wrong, the process should be terminated by responding Error 403, so phoneNumberMatch becomes always 'true', so there is no need of it.
  * Toshi asked Javier Carro and Fernando to create an Issue for that, so that it can be discussed by the SP.  Specifically, Toshi told that KDDI needed to discuss internally and would send feedback to the issue.
  * ->Telefonica also proposed to resolve this issue quickly by end of the week, so that KYC SP could publish the release version of Match/Fill-in v0.1.0, and then Fernando created the Issue #59 straightaway, and so, all members were requested to review the Issue as quickly as possible. **AI #10.02 (All)**


### Match/Fill-in v0.2.0 – wip

* Issue #38 Proposition of design evolution ([Issue #38](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/38))
  * Discussion ongoing

* Issue #39 Polymorphism and discriminator for specific requirements ([Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/39))
* PR #43 Match API Design evolution proposal ([PR #43](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/pull/43))
  * Discussion ongoing.  PR #43 has been created by Gilles Orange for Issue #39, but it is not-to-be-merged.

* Issue #47 Data Minimization for Protection Against Misuse of KYC Data ([Issue #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/47))
  * Discussion ongoing.


### Age Verification v0.1.0 – wip

* Issue #46 Creation of a Pull Request for Age Verification API ([Issue #46](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/46))
