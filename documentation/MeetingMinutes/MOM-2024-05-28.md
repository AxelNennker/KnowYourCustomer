* Uploading the meeting 2024-05-14 material; [PR #83](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/pull/783), created on May 21st ->No comments and approved.
* Actions:
  * Closed: AI #08.01, #13.01, #13.03

  * Closure of AI #13.01 was confirmed in the related agenda later.
  * AI #08.02, #09.01 and #11.01 are thought to be closed. To be checked by next meeting.

* In relation to AI #08.02, Telefonica Clara shared their view that for Age Verification API, attributes other than Age should be made completely optional, because it may result in application developer’s confusion between Age Verification API and KYC Match API if Age Verification API’s request body has additional attributes e.g. name and email address.  KDDI Toshi suggested to discuss this topic in the later Age Verification agenda as the moderator, and, from KDDI perspective, agreed with Telefonica’s view.

## Review Issues & PRs

### General
* Issue #75 Select API for CAMARA Meta-Release September ([Issue #75](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/75))
  * Discussion ongoing
  * Need to fill in all the necessary items on the release-management template which exists in the KYC-SP’s wiki page. This is one of the steps required for the meta-release. (DT Axel) ->Will study to fill in. (KDDI Toshi)

* Issue #92 Tenure API to be handled in KYC-SP regular meeting and ML ([Issue #92](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/92))
  * Discussion ongoing
  * There was no comment.  Agreed that Tenure API will use KYC-SP regular meetings and KYC-SP ML

* Match scoring enhancement was proposed through API Backlog  API Backlog ([Issue #45](https://github.com/camaraproject/APIBacklog/issues/45) / ([PR #46](https://github.com/camaraproject/APIBacklog/pull/46)
  * Discussion ongoing
  * Toshi explained our situation that we have an issue for that, and that we are discussing it.  Toshi understand we continue our discussion, taking the proposed template into consideration.  Toshi pointed out that KYC Match API (enhanced or whatever it is called) should work without Scoring as some markets/operators/API users do not need Scoring, and that was endorsed by API Backlog WG.
  * Related to Issue #85
  * Telefonica Clara commented that backward compatibility is required, as Telefonica has implemented KYC-Match v0.1.0.  KDDI Toshi seconded that.
  * Continue discussion on Issue #85.

* API Backlog 2024/05/23  Telco Scoring API to be handled in KYC-SP regular meetings?
  * New item. Asked what members think?
  * Telco Scoring API proposal: API Backlog  ([Issue #41](https://github.com/camaraproject/APIBacklog/issues/41) / ([PR #42](https://github.com/camaraproject/APIBacklog/pull/42)
  * KDDI Toshi commented that his understand was that this API is related to Credit Scoring and Credit Scoring does not have much to do with KYC information. Taking KYC-SP’s workload (many APIs), he feels it is difficult for KYC-SP to include Telco Scoring API. 
  * Telefonica Jorge Garcia commented that Telco Scoring API has much to do with KYC, as it would use the same data/information for Scoring. 
  * Continue discussion.
