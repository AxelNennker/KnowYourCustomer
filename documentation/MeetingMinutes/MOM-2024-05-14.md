## Review Issues & PRs

### Match/Fill-in v0.1.0 – released version

* Issue #18 KYC Match – Compare specifications ([Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/18))
  * Remaining discussions will be moved to a new issue for v0.2.0.  AI #13.01 (Toshi) is still open.

* Issue #22 KYC Match – KYC Match Request / Response attribute suffix ([Issue #22](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/22))
  * Remaining discussions can be moved to a new issue for v0.2.0.  AI #13.02 (Toshi) is still open.

* PR #57 Create CHANGELOG.MD  ([PR #57](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/pull/57)) 
  * Need to check if this can be merged or should be closed without being merged, as PR #61 was merged. 

* Issue #79 Small release v0.1.1 to fix country example ([Issue #79](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/79)) <br> PR #80 Update description and example of country property to alpha-2  ([PR #80](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/pull/80)) 
  * Ongoing discussion
  * Issue #79 and PR #80 were proposed by Telefonica.  In KYC-Match v0.1.0, the example of 'country' attribute is "Japan" (name of country), but Telefonica would like to change it to one of Alpha-2 country codes.  Device Status API (Roaming Status) uses Alpha-2 country codes, and Telefonica is implementing KYC-Match API with Alpha-2 country codes. (Telefonica Fernando)
  * Fine with Orange.  (Orange Gilles)
  * May I suggest changing the attribute to 'countryCode' or something? (KDDI Toshi)
  * Device Status API uses 'countryCode' attribute for MCC, so Telefonica would suggest using 'country' attribute to avoid potential confusion.  Proposal is just to modify the example and not to touch the core v0.1.0 specification. (Telefonica Fernando)
  * Fine with Orange.  Scrutiny of country-related attributes should be addressed in v0.2.0 discussion.  Orange thinks of using TM Forum format for that. (Orange Gilles)
  * Agree to revisit this topic in v0.2.0 discussion.  For example, Device Status API uses 'countryName' for Alpha-2 codes, and OIDF/OIDC specficications use 'countryCode' for Alpha-2 codes. (KDDI Toshi)
  * As both Telefonica and Orange are implementing the Match v0.1.0, this matter should be concluded quickly. (Orange Gilles, Telefonica Fernando)
  * It seems it could be agreed that KYC-Match v0.1.0 uses 'country' attribute for Alpha-2 codes and includes an example of Alpha-2 code.  However, taking it into account that some members are absent, we could accept any comments within 24 hours if any.  (KDDI Toshi)
