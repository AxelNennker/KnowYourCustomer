## Review Issues & PRs

### New
* **Issue #100 Release v0.1.1 (Fernando TEF) [Merged]** ([PR #100](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/pull/100))
  * Opened on June 13thh; approved and merged
  * Create release branch for KYC Match/Fill-in v0.1.1 and include CHANGLOG.md.  (The approved PR #80 has already created v0.1.1 YAML.)
  * **[06/25]** v0.1.1 is only for minor updates including modification of country field example, and v0.1.1 content itself had been updated by PR #80.  This PR #100 is just for version number change and Changelog update.

* **Issue #101 [KYC Match] Will there be a minimum number of properties in the request body? (Ola GSMA)** ([Issue #101](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/101))
  * Opened on June 19th; Discussion ongoing.
  * For KYC Match v0.1.1.
  * **[06/25]** Ola GSMA: At least any one property must be included in the request body? 
  * ->Toshi KDDI: the request body needs at least one property, which will be checked with the MNO's data. phoneNumber, i.e. identity, is also needed as mandatory, isn't it?
  * ->Fernando TEF) phoneNumber could be retrieved from Access Token, so, at least one property must be included, in addition to phoneNumber.
  * ->Fernando TEF) That will be documented in the next update.
  * ->Toshi KDDI) OK. Toshi will write the comment to GitHub Issue #101.   **AI#17.01 (Toshi)**

* **PR #103 Align yaml with commonalities v0.3 (Fernando TEF)** ([PR #103](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/pull/103))
  * Opened on June 20th; Discussion ongoing
  * For KYC Match/Fill-in v0.1.1?
  * Align with commonalities v0.3.  How about v0.4?
  * **[06/25]** **Agreed, as aliment with the Commonalities items is mandatory for Meta-release.**
  * Toshi KDDI: It is understood that v0.4 is coming separatly.  Correct? ->Fernande TEF: Correct. v0.4 is mandatory for Fall24 Meta-release.

* **PR #104 Include score functionality proposal (Fernando TEF)**  ([PR #104](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/pull/104)) 
  * Opened on June 20th ; Discussion ongoing.  For Match v0.2.0.
  * To fix ([Issue #85](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/85) ([KYC Match] Scoring) and ([Issue #96](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/96)) (Create a common enum for attributeMatch result)
  * **[06/25]** Clara TEF: Telefoncia's YAML proposal. Comments are welcome. This PR includes the above two issues.
  * ->Toshi KDDI: Need some time to check the yaml.
  * Toshi KDDI: One comment is, as commented in Issue #85, that scoring algorithm should not be mandatory, because there may be more suitable algorithm existing for each country and each language. 
  * ->TEF: If algorithm is different from countries and languages, the same request may receive different scoring results, which will be an issue.
  * ->Kevin Scarr VDF: Jaro-Winkler algorithm has not been used for other languages than European langages.  Send link to a website to Toshi.
    * Here is the link to the security website that has Jaro-Winkler already implemented.
    * https://asecuritysite.com/hashsim/simstring
  * Toshi KDDI: In the first place, do we need to specify this kind of algorithm in the API specification?  
  * ->TEF: It is needed for Developers' understanding.
  * ->Toshi KDDI: Then, how about making Jaro-Winkler algorithm as recommendation or as guideline for European language or Europe countries, but keeping algorithm TBD for other languages and countries?
  * ->Kevin Scarr VDF) How about writing this sentence in the specification? Proposed: "Unless otherwise captured in the specification, score will use the Jaro-Winkler distance algorithm for all countries."
  * ->Toshi KDD: Sounds agreeable.
  * ->Clara TEF: Please try Jaro-Winkler algorithm with KDDI's data to find if it works for Japanese language.
  * ->Toshi KDDI: I am no quite sure if we can do that, as we do not provide Match Scoring now, but I will discuss internally about trying it. **AI #17.01 (Toshi)**
  * Gilles Orange: Orange proposed another endpoint for Match Scoring.
  * ->TEF: It is better to have only one endpoint for KYC Match.
  * TEF: Telefonica wants to include Match Scoring in Fall24 Meta-release. How will we proceed with this proposal?
  * ->Toshi KDDI: Taking Meta-release schedule into account, I understand we have to proceed rapidly. ** Keep this discussion open until our next meeting on 9th July, and next meeting is the target to clear issues.**  Let's continue discussion on GitHub.
  * ->** Agreed. **

### Age Verification v0.1.0 – wip

* Issue #46 Creation of a Pull Request for Age Verification API ([Issue #46](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/46))
  * Discussion ongoing; Gille's summary appreciated.
  * **[06/25]** Toshi KDDI: commented in Issue #46. If age verification true/false is needed and scoring is not needed, what will be the mandatory parameters?
  * ->Gilles Orange: Age only.  phoneNumber is optional.
  * Toshi KDDI: It is understood that Age Verification v0.1.0 is candidate for Fall24 Meta-release.  But, which should be prioritised, Age Verification or Match Scoring?
  * ->Clara TEF: Match Scoring should be priortised, though it is not meant to stop Age Verification.
  * ->Toshi KDDI: If other members agree with it, from KYC-SP point of view, it is OK.  But Age Verification API is a GSMA Drop #3 API and from GSMA point of view, it is expected to be completed as early as possible.  From KDDI side, Age Verification is an important one and early completion is expected.
