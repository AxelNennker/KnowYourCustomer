## Review Issues & PRs

### General - Meta-release overall status was reviewed first.
* Issue #75 Select API for CAMARA Meta-Release September ([Issue #75](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/75))
  * Ongoing discussion
  * **Target confirmed:**
    * **KYC Match v0.2 (v0.1 initial + v0.2 adds scoring)**
    * **KYC Fill-in v0.1 (initial)**
    * Age Verification v0.1 (initial) -> de-prioritized and not included in Fall24
    * **Release: Initial public release**
  * **[August 20th]**
    * **Should test files be made available by M4 deadline (2024/08/26)?**
    <br> Yes, but it is unclear how strictly the deadline for test files will be applied, because there are many APIs that have not test files available yet.
    <br> Anyway, it was agreed to try to create test files by the deadline.  Issues will be opened first.  Fernando TEF for KYC Match, Toshi KDDI for KYC Fill-in.  **AI #21.01 (Fernando TEF, Toshi KDDI)**
    * **Do we have to create another PR for Release r1.1 or Meta-release, in addition to PR #119 Pre-release r1.1 which has been merged?**
    <br> Yes, Release PR is required.  Release PR would have some differences from Pre-release PR; for example, Changelog, Checklist (test files "to be available" to "Yes"), etc.  Release PR's deadline is August 26th.
    * **after the meeting**  Deadline for Release PR is August 26th, but the deadline for test files (and other release items) is August 30th, since Release PR is expected to get ready for approval/merging by August 30th.


### New

* **Issue #133 KYC-match: When provider decides which information to not send - expected response/Output?  / Natylee93** ([Issue #133](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/133))
  * Opened on 2024/08/14.  For Fill-in, not Match?
  * **[August 20th]** Toshi has commented his answer for Fill-in.  Natylee93's respose is awaited, as Natlee93 was not in,
  
* **Issue #134 KYC Match : CountryMatchScore makes no sense / Huub KPN** ([Issue #134](https://github.com/camaraproject/KnowYourCustomer/issues/134))
  * Opened on 2024/08/14.  
  * For Match, as ‘Country’ has now become ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, countryMatchScore is not needed.
  <br> ->Makes sense.  Can this be incorporated into Fall24 meta?
  * **[August 20th]** Fernando TEF will open a PR for this Issue, to incorporate this into Meta release.  **AI #21.02 (Fernando TEF)**

  * Subproject Management.
  * **[August 20th]** Toshi will start using LF Confluence. This has been one of Toshi's actions for a while.  After the current Meta-release rush, so probablly from next meeting.  Maybe from this meeting's minutes, but unlikely.
